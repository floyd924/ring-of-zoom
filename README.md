## Ring Of Zoom

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

run `npm install` inside the project directory to install all required packages

run `npm start` to launch the application on localhost:3000

## Adding/modifying further data

There is no back end. All data is stored in `src/game/data.ts`. Modify this file directly to add, update, or delete any rules.

## Filenames

Yes. I know they are questionable. I made this app wth 1 intention - to get my mates drunk. And it works.
