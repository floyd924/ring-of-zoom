## Ring Of Zoom

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

run `npm install` inside the project directory to install all required packages

run `npm start` to launch the application on localhost:3000

## Adding/modifying further data

There is no back end. All data is stored in `src/game/data.ts`. Modify this file directly to add, update, or delete any rules.

## Filenames

Yes. I know they are questionable. I made this app wth 1 intention - to get my mates drunk. And it works.


## How to play

### Screen 3 - Game

Click 'draw next card' to, um, draw the next card. The current player (highlighted in red) will be given instructions based on the card they draw. 

All drawn cards will appear on the right of the screen

At one point in the game a random player will be informed they have broken the circle while drawing a card. It is up to you to decide what this person's punishment should be.
